# ComfyUI-DiscordBot

**ComfyUI-DiscordBot** is a Discord bot designed specifically for image generation using a local install of ComfyUI as the backend with various AI Image Generation models. It's inspired by the features of the Midjourney Discord bot, offering capabilities like text-to-image generation.

## Key Features:

1. **Text-to-Image Generation**: Convert your ideas into visuals. Just type in a positive+negative prompt, and the bot will generate an image that matches your text.

2. **Local ComfyUI System**: For users who prioritize data privacy or want to work offline, the bot can run locally using the ComfyUI system.

3. **Custom Workflows with ComfyUI**: The bot comes with default configurations. However, if you have specific needs, it supports custom ComfyUI workflows, allowing you to tailor the bot's operations to your exact requirements.

## Quick Start

## Configuration
- Open `config.properties` using a text editor.
- Set your Discord bot token: Find `[BOT][TOKEN]` and replace the placeholder with your token.

## Local System via ComfyUI
- Set your ComfyUI URL: Replace the placeholder in `[LOCAL][SERVER_ADDRESS]` with your ComfyUI URL (default is `127.0.0.1:8188`).
- Ensure that ComfyUI is running while the bot is running
